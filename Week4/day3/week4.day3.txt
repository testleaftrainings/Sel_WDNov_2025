A plugin is a software add-on that is installed on a program to add a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plugins, it enables customization. 

In the Eclipse, a plugin like TestNG can be installed to extend its capabilities to manage and run tests more effectively. 

-----------------------------------------------------
Welcome to TestNG : 

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

1) Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc…​).

2) Test that your code is multithread safe.

3) Flexible test configuration.

4) Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).

5) Support for parameters.

6) Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).

7) Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc…​).

8) Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.

9) Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).

10) Dependent methods for application server testing.

1.2. Introduction


TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, from unit testing (testing a class in isolation of the others) to integration testing (testing entire systems made of several classes, several packages and even several external frameworks, such as application servers).

Writing a test is typically a three-step process:

1) Write the business logic of your test and insert TestNG annotations in your code.

2) Add the information about your test (e.g. the class name, the groups you wish to run, etc…​) in a testng.xml file or in build.xml.

3) Run TestNG.

Steps to start with TestNG: 

Convert normal script into a TestNG script: 

*Remove static keyword from the main method 

*Remove the input arguments(String[] args) 

*Give a meaningful name to the method 

*Add @Test on the top of the method 

**Import from org.testng.annotations. 

*Right click on the testcase Run as-> 1 TestNG Test 


1.3. Documentation


The concepts used in this documentation are as follows:

#<suite>: A suite is represented by one XML file. It can contain one or more tests and is defined by the <suite> tag.

#<test>: A test is represented by <test> and can contain one or more TestNG classes.

#<class>: A TestNG class is a Java class that contains at least one TestNG annotation. It is represented by the <class> tag and can contain one or more test methods.

# A test method is a Java method annotated by @Test in your source


################## Parallel Execution ################################



| `<suite parallel>` | `<test parallel>` | Thread-Control | Execution Flow Type                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `classes`          | (ignored)         | Suite-level    | All classes globally                                            |
| `tests`            | (ignored)         | Suite-level    | Tests run in parallel                                           |
| `none`             | `classes`         | Per test       | Each test runs sequentially, but classes inside run in parallel |
| 'tests'            |  'classes'        | at suite -> Tests |   2*2 = 4                                 |
                                          at test--> classess

------------
✅ 1. <suite parallel="classes" thread-count="2">

<suite parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
    <test name="Group1">
        <classes>TestClass1 to TestClass5</classes>
    </test>
    <test name="Group2">
        <classes>TestClass6 to TestClass10</classes>
    </test>
</suite>

👉 TestNG runs all classes in all <test>s, 2 at a time

T1: TestClass1 → TestClass3 → TestClass5 → TestClass7 → TestClass9
T2: TestClass2 → TestClass4 → TestClass6 → TestClass8 → TestClass10


✅ 2. <suite parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
Each <test> runs in parallel (not classes inside).

<suite parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
    <test name="Group1">
        <classes>TestClass1 to TestClass5</classes>
    </test>
    <test name="Group2">
        <classes>TestClass6 to TestClass10</classes>
    </test>
</suite>

🚀 Execution (both tests start in parallel):
T1: Group1: TestClass1 → TestClass2 → TestClass3 → TestClass4 → TestClass5
T2: Group2: TestClass6 → TestClass7 → TestClass8 → TestClass9 → TestClass10


✅ 3. <suite parallel="none">, but <test parallel="classes" thread-count="2">

<suite parallel="none">
    <test name="Group1" parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
        <classes>TestClass1 to TestClass5</classes>
    </test>
    <test name="Group2" parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
        <classes>TestClass6 to TestClass10</classes>
    </test>
</suite>

📦 Sequential test groups, but classes inside each test run in parallel

Group1 runs first:
T1: TestClass1 → TestClass3 → TestClass5
T2: TestClass2 → TestClass4

Then Group2:
T1: TestClass6 → TestClass8 → TestClass10
T2: TestClass7 → TestClass9
